1. Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector/querySelectorAll
   ðŸ”‘ Key differences:
   getElementById â†’ single element by id
   getElementsByClassName â†’ multiple elements, live collection
   querySelector â†’ first element with CSS selector
   querySelectorAll â†’ all elements, static NodeList

2. How to create and insert a new element into the DOM
   You can create and insert elements using the DOM API:

   > Step 1: Create a new element
   > Step 2: Add content or attributes
   > Step 3: Insert into DOM
   > appendChild() â†’ adds inside, at the end
   > prepend() â†’ adds inside, at the beginning

3. What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?
   Definition: Event bubbling is the process where an event triggered on a child element propagates up (bubbles) through its ancestors (parent, grandparent, â€¦) until it reaches document.

4. What is Event Delegation? Why is it useful?
   Definition: Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element, and handle events for its child elements inside that handler (using event.target).
   Why useful?
   More efficient â†’ one listener instead of many.
   Works for dynamically added elements (future elements).
5. Difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation()
   preventDefault(): Prevents the default action of an element.
   stopPropagation(): Stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
   preventDefault() = stops browserâ€™s default behavior
   stopPropagation() = stops event bubbling
